# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://gitlab.com/-/experiment/new_project_readme_content:a9f7f53e3c711557c511390e399af262?https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

# WisePops Frontend Test

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Basics

Unagi is on a mission to upgrade fantasy sport game to a new level.

In this exercise, we'll test your React skills by creating a simple collection card website.

The project is already setup in this repository so to start, fork it and when
you are done, invite @hmatthieu to collaborate on it.

Don't spend more than 4 hours on this test.

## Steps

For each step that follows you will have to edit some files already provided,
but don't hesitate to go further. Also, it will be great if you split your
steps using branches or commits.

Don't hesitate to over-engineer the problem a bit, so we will be able to see
how you will work, split and organize your file on a real project.

``` sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start API & Dev server
yarn start
```

### 1. Show a static card on `/collection` page

Go to [Collection.tsx](src/pages/Collection.tsx) file and fill `Collection` component to show
a card that contains the message stored in `card` variable.

This page can be seen on http://localhost:8000/collection

### 2. Fetch collection from a fake REST API

Go to [collection.ts](/src/lib/collection.ts) file and replace `fetchCollection` function
body to fetch cards from http://localhost:8001/cards instead.

This will imply some change on `Collection` component too.

### 3. Edit the popup on `/create-card` page

Go to [CreateCard.tsx](/src/pages/CreateCard.tsx) file and fill `CreateCard` component to
be able to create a card. For information, we use
[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a fake API server.
So you will be able to persist change on this API.
(Basically, you can POST json onto http://localhost:8001/cards)

### 4. Show all the card as a collection

On a real use case, we don't want to show only one card so adapts the code to show each
cards in a collection (a grid of cards for example).
Make sure that this screen is responsive.

## Scoring

You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Functionality (Does your code work ? Think build, warnings, error management)
- Readability (Is your code maintainable ? Think code splitting, Typescript, Git)
- Creativity is a bonus (Did you go further the scope ?) but should not interfere with the two previous point.
